## UNDETECTABLE KEYLOGGER FOR WINDOWS 

**Disclaimer:
It is important to note that creating and using a keylogger without the explicit consent of the user is illegal and unethical. The purpose of this blog post is to provide educational content on how keyloggers can be created, and the security implications involved. The techniques and methods described in this post should not be used to engage in any illegal or unethical activities.

## ðŸ”§ Tools Used
To build this keylogger, I used the following tools and technologies:

C++
PowerShell scripting language
Telegram Bot API

## ðŸš€ Getting Started
To start, I created a new C++ console application and included the necessary header files for keyboard input monitoring. I then wrote code to capture keystrokes and store them in a text file. However, this alone was not enough, as the keylogger needed to be able to send the keystrokes to a receiver.

To achieve this, I used PowerShell to read the contents of the text file and send them to a Telegram bot. I created a new bot using the Telegram Bot API and obtained an API token, which I used to authenticate requests to the bot. I then wrote a PowerShell script to send a POST request to the Telegram bot API with the contents of the text file.
