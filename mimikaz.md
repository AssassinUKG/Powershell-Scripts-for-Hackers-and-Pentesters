## Steps to install Mimikaz 
To use Mimikatz in PowerShell, you will need to download the Mimikatz binary from the official GitHub repository (https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz/releases) and save it on your local machine. Then, you can use the following PowerShell command to load the Mimikatz DLL into memory:


```
[Reflection.Assembly]::LoadFile("C:\Path\To\Mimikatz.exe")
```

Replace "C:\Path\To\Mimikatz.exe" with the actual path to the Mimikatz binary on your local machine.


Once the Mimikatz DLL is loaded into memory, you can use the various Mimikatz commands and functions in PowerShell.
