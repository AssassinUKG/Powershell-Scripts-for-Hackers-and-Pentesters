##### (10) Ping and a Traceroute

Test your machine connectivity to a network resource by performing a ping and a traceroute using Test-NetConnection

```
Test-NetConnection -ComputerName 192.168.1.100
```
Explanation:<br>This will perform a ping and a traceroute to the remote system and display the results.

You can also use the Test-NetConnection cmdlet to test the connectivity to a remote system by its hostname . To do that 

```
Test-NetConnection -ComputerName remote-system.example.com
```
Additionally, you can use the -Port parameter with Test-NetConnection to test connectivity to a specific port on a remote system . To do that

```
Test-NetConnection -ComputerName remote-system.example.com -Port 80
```
Explanation:<br>
This is an example to test the connectivity to port 80 on a remote system, you can use the above Command
